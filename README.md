# predicting_bike_rentals

Aim of this project is to predict the number of bike rentals in a US city with a model trained on historic bike rental data and weather related data. Three different models are compared: linear regression, decision tree regression and random forest regression.

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data science with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

## Results

To display the result, simply [click the .ipynb file](https://github.com/jasperquak/predicting_bike_rentals/blob/main/PredictingBikeRentals.ipynb) in this repository. It will open in a Notebook viewer.
